I am a research engineer at New York University. My advisors are [Nikhil Gupta](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/nikhil-gupta) and [Ramesh Karri](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/ramesh-karri).

I obtained my PhD degree from University of Connecticut. My PhD advisor is [Horea T. Ilies](https://me.engr.uconn.edu/blog/faculty/ilies-horea-t/). I was a postdoc at Carnegie Mellon University (Jan. 2023-Jan. 2025), advised by [Christopher McComb](https://engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/mccomb-christopher.html) and [Sneha Prabha Narra](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/narra-sneha.html). 

Research interests
------
My research focuses on developing a cyber-physical system that integrates the design, simulations, and manufacturing control enhanced by machine learning for additive manufacturing (AM). It aims to solve the two largest challenges faced by current AM technologies: inaccurate quality control and outdated design frameworks. This system features a real-time digital twin to improve manufacturing quality and a design optimization framework to unlock the full potential of AM in creating structures with multi-scale properties for multi-physic purpose.
